## Sample Output

The [output_results.txt](output_results.txt) file shows the terminal output for a single run of the simulator:

* Epoch and batch number
* Time taken in each part of the pipeline
* After the simulation ends it outputs a list of lists, each list containing the epoch number and corresponding metric such as accuracy or IOU.
